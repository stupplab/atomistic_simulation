This repository contains all you need top run the atomistic simulations of PAs.

`script.py` is the main script that is run first. Look inside to see how it works and how the parameters are defined.
It will create a folder simulation for the simulation instance of the defined parameters.

# Note

Remember to add the custom made PA residues `C16` `C12` `12C` `SPI` to `residuetypes.dat`. On macos, this should be located as 

`/usr/local/gromacs/share/gromacs/top/residuetypes.dat`
